**Summary: Crimes Against Women: Insights and Patterns by State (2000â€“2021)**


This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of crimes committed against women across various Indian states between 2000 and 2021. 
The objective is to highlight key trends and patterns, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the crime landscape in relation to domestic violence (DV), assault on women (AoW),
rape,kidnapping and abduction (K&A), and workplace harassment (WT).


**Key Insights:**

Total Crimes: Over 5 million reported crimes against women across all states, emphasizing the ongoing critical need for stronger protections and legal action.

State-wise Analysis: States like West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan consistently show higher incidences of DV, AoW, and K&A, making them focal points for interventions.

Yearly Trends: The total number of reported AoW cases has seen a marked increase since 2010, indicating either a rise in incidents or an improvement in reporting mechanisms.

Rape and Assault Patterns: Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal are particularly concerning with high numbers of both rape and assault cases, requiring focused law enforcement and policy attention.

Workplace Harassment (WT): Although WT accounts for a smaller portion of total crimes, its incidence is significantly underreported, calling for more robust workplace safety protocols for women.


**Concluding Insight:**


This dashboard offers an accessible yet powerful view of the alarming rates of violence against women, emphasizing the geographical concentration of incidents. Policymakers, law enforcement,
and advocacy groups can use this data to direct resources to the most affected states, track the impact of policy changes over time, and raise public awareness for women's safety and rights.
